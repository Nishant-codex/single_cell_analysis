PHD chapters:

1. Clustering 
Questions asked:
    a. How many exc/inh subtypes can be identified?
        i. Can they be identified by thier resonant properties? 
        ii. Can they be identified by thier physiological properties? 
        iii. Can they be identified by thier waveform shapes?  
    b. Do cell groups remain invariant to the type of input they recieve
    c. Does the input filter has someting to do with the physiological properties of neurons?  
    d. Which cell features are the most important in cell identification? 

2. Clustering with Drug conditions 
    a. using the clusters found above, compare the sub classes with their drug counter parts 
        i. identifying if there is a difference between E/I types in drug condition
        ii. biological plausibility for the differences if observed
    b. back track the properties that change across sub classes for each drug if any 

3. Modelling (party done with Yiota and Simone)
    a. using the features identified for the different cell classes, try to create a neuron model 
        i. using resontant, filtering and adaptive properties 
    b. try to extend the model for drug conditions using the features important identified features
    ? answer questions related to moving cells from one cell class to another  

4. prospective ideas
    a. studying network properties of these neuron models and possibly checking for neuromorphic viabliilty 
        i. simulating neuromodulation at a network scale if the single neuron models turn out to be good enough 

collaborations 
    i. Using siamese network to identify cell signature using CC and FN 
    ii. using Guido's neuropixel data to identify cell classes and the effect of serotonin 
    iii. identifying excitability types using RNNs 


Secondment aims: 

To get to a point where I have a working model of neurons that are characteristic of neuromulator such as dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine and possibly study the network effects 

how to get there:
1. start simple models of neurons and see if a variable adjusts the firing rate of neurons 
2.
